Hi there,
I like to work like a data Scientist
I'm working on a Webscraping project with R
The link: https://duproprio.com/fr/quebec-rive-sud/levis/maison-a-vendre?
The goal of this project is to get data from this Website then, we use this data to analyzing and forecasting of House Price using multiple linear Regression 
In  this project we use tidyverse and Rvest package
Just copy and paste the file to RStudio and Run the code.
Enjoy, you can send me an email if you have a question.
